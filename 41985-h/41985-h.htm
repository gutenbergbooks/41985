<tr><td>
<p class="cap">WE were bereft ere we were well aware<br />
Of all our precious fears, and had instead<br />
A hopeless safety, a secure despair.<br />
We know that fate dealt kindly with our dead,<br />
Tenderer to that fair face we held so dear<br />
Than unto many another's best beloved.<br />
Whate'er befall, we know him far removed<br />
From all the weary labours of last year,<br />
And even in paying this most bitter price<br />
We know the cause worthy the sacrifice.<br />
Now he is safe from any further ill,<br />
Nor toils in peril while at ease we sit,<br />
Yet bides our loss in thinking of him still,&mdash;<br />
Of sombre eyes, by sudden laughter lit,<br />
Darkened till all the eternal stars shall wane;<br />
And lost the incommunicable lore<br />
Of cunning fingers ne'er to limn again<br />
And restless hands at rest for ever more.</p></td></tr></table>

Lie lost with him, the greatest loss of all,<br />
We grudge to well-won rest<br />
His swiftness to devise and dare<br />
That never failed the call."<br />
<br />
Thus they all spoke together of the dead<br />
Who was their comrade many a dark hour through,<br />
As one whose work was ended quite,<br />
But he that held him dearest said<br />
Nothing, for well he knew<br />
<br />
His friend forsook them not in dying.<br />
&mdash;Often above the din he seemed to hear<br />
His well known voice beloved,<br />
Often in mud and darkness lying,<br />
Felt he was working near,<br />
<br />
By star-shell light oft with that commonplace<br />
Familiar kindness knowing not surprise<br />
Just as in other nights now lost,<br />
Suddenly glimpsed his face,<br />
Unchanged the same sleep-burdened eyes,<br />
<br />
Whimsical brows and laughter-lifted lip;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span><br />
And turned again to labours lighter grown,<br />
Glad of that unforgetful soul's<br />
Imperishable fellowship<br />
That left him not to serve alone.</p></td></tr></table>

Death, and delaying not to go, they said<br />
Farewell to hope, to dear tasks left undone,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To well-loved faces and to length of days.&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So came they to the parting of the ways,</span><br />
A year agone, and saw no way but one.<br />
<br />
Others, and they were many, watched them go<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But turned not from the pleasant path of ease,</span><br />
With hedges full of flowers, and fields of sheep.<br />
Their hearts waxed gross, battening on braver woe<br />

No trump avails but Thine to break their sleep!</p></td></tr></table>

<h2><i>Night in the Suburbs, August</i>, 1914</h2>


<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">
<tr><td>
<p class="cap">THE misty night broods o'er this peopled place,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Chimneys and trees stand black against the sky,</span><br />
One goes belated by with echoing pace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And careless whistle, shrilling loud and high.</span><br />
<br />
And ere his steps into the stillness merge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Some labouring giant of our later day</span><br />
Passes with hollow roar of distant surge<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And clouds of steam as white as ocean spray.</span><br />
<br />
In turn the lighted windows, twinkling fair,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Darken, till all these earthborn stars are down;</span><br />
Stained dusky red by the great city's glare<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The waning moon hangs low o'er London Town.</span><br />
<br />
E'en now that moon in her own silver guise<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Looks down on some stretched on a stricken plain,</span><br />
Yet she shows red unto their blood-dimmed eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That never shall behold the sun again.</span><br />
<br />
We, weary of the idle watch we keep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turn from the window to our sure repose</span><br />
And pass into the pleasant realms of sleep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Or snug and drowsy muse upon their woes.</span><br />
<br />
And whether we that sleep or they that wake,&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We that have laboured light and slumber well</span><br />
Or they that bled and battled for our sake&mdash;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Have the best portion scarce seems hard to tell.</span><br />
<br />
Soon shall the sun behold them, where they lie,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet his fierce rays may never warm them more;</span><br />
No further need have they to strive or cry,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They have found rest that laboured long and sore;</span><br />
<br />
While we take up again in street and mart<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The burden and the business of the day:</span><br />
And which of these two is the better part<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">God only knows, whose face is turned away.</span></p></td></tr></table>

I walked that lonely road to-night<br />

<br />
The voice of the wind called shrill and high<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like a bugle band of ghosts,</span><br />
And the restless leaves that shuffled by<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Seemed the tread of the phantom hosts.</span><br />
<br />
Mayhap when the shadows gather round<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the low skies lower with rain,</span><br />
The dead that rot upon outland ground<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">March down the road again.</span></p></td></tr></table>

Their high hearts rose above the swollen tide,<br />
Fain of the foe upon the further side,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though in death's draught their lips they needs must steep.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Since their own lives their valour might not keep,</span><br />
Our tall young men drank of that cup and died.<br />
<br />
Now are their faces hidden from the sky,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Under the trampled turf where last they trod;</span><br />
Yet unforsaken sleeps that sad array;<br />
The living hearts of all their mothers lie<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Buried with them, and beat below the sod,</span><br />
As their poor pulse could stir the senseless clay.</p></td></tr></table>

Our eyes were holden, that we saw them not;<br />

Behind us massed, a mighty host indeed,<br />

Forwent their rest to save us at our need.</p></td></tr></table>

On the devout and careless, passing by.<br />
The Cross had shaken with his agony,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His blood had stained the dancing grasses brown,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But when we found him, though the weary frown,</span><br />
That waited on death's long delayed mercy,<br />
Still bent his brow, yet he was dead and cold,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With drooping head and patient eyes astare,</span><br />
That would not shut. As we stood turned to ice<br />
The sun remembered Golgotha of old,<br />

In mockery of that fruitless sacrifice.</p></td></tr></table>

<h2><i>The Last Evening</i></h2>


<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">
<tr><td>
<p class="cap">ROUND a bright isle, set in a sea of gloom,<br />
We sat together, dining,<br />
And spoke and laughed even as in better times<br />
Though each one knew no other might misdoubt<br />
The doom that marched moment by moment nigher,<br />
Whose couriers knocked on every heart like death,<br />
And changed all things familiar to our sight<br />
Into strange shapes and grieving ghosts that wept.<br />
The crimson-shaded light<br />
Shed in the garden roses of red fire<br />
That burned and bloomed on the decorous limes.<br />
The hungry night that lay in wait without<br />
Made blind, blue eyes against the silver's shining<br />
And waked the affrighted candles with its breath<br />
Out of their steady sleep, while round the room<br />
The shadows crouched and crept.<br />
Among the legions of beleaguering fears,<br />
Still we sat on and kept them still at bay,<br />
A little while, a little longer yet,<br />
And wooed the hurrying moments to forget<br />
What we remembered well,<br />
&mdash;Till the hour struck&mdash;then desperately we sought<br />
And found no further respite&mdash;only tears<br />
We would not shed, and words we might not say.<br />
We needs must know that now the time was come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span><br />
Yet still against the strangling foe we fought,<br />
And some of us were brave and some<br />
Borrowed a bubble courage nigh to breaking,<br />
And he that went, perforce went speedily<br />
And stayed not for leave-taking.<br />
But even in going, as he would dispel<br />
The bitterness of incomplete good-byes,<br />
He paused within the circle of dim light,<br />
And turned to us a face, lit seemingly<br />
Less by the lamp than by his shining eyes.<br />
So, in the radiance of his mastered fate,<br />
A moment stood our soldier by the gate<br />
And laughed his long farewell&mdash;<br />
Then passed into the silence and the night.</p></td></tr></table>

<p class="cap">SHE read the words of him that was her own:<br />
The dauntless brow that grief itself had steeled<br />
Quickened with listening ever, not in vain<br />
Amid brave stories of the stricken field,<br />
For strange, sad echoes from a child's heart grown<br />
Untimely old, that scarce will dance again<br />
This side the grave, but nathless keeps a leaven<br />
Of mirth most bitter sweet.<br />
So changed her face, 'twixt pride and sorrowing,<br />
As stirs and shadows sun-bleached wheat<br />
With winds that walk the stair of heaven<br />

When you've grown taller, and harder to please,<br />
Will you turn sometimes your wandering wishes<br />
Back to the hours when with eyes full of laughter<br />
You watched where the day-dreaming willow trees<br />
Dipped their long fingers to catch at the fishes,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Mock sails flying on mimic seas?</span></p></td></tr></table>

<h2><i>The Lovers' Walk</i></h2>


<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="table">
<tr><td>
<p class="cap">TWO lovers walked in a green garden way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Neath towering poplar pillars all arow;</span><br />
The still June midnight close about them lay:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">They whispered soft and low.</span><br />
<br />
Though they could feel no wind, they heard it creep<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">High in the poplars, whispering secret schemes;</span><br />
The tall trees stood as sentinels asleep,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And listening through their dreams.</span><br />
<br />
The full moon's white fire lamp hung round and fair<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Above the highest poplar's shivering crest,</span><br />
The lazy fountain's waters stirred the air<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And softly sank to rest.</span><br />
<br />
Unseen the honeysuckle trailed that fills<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The dim air with its heavy sweet perfume,</span><br />
But the wan fire-eyed wraiths of daffodils<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Stared spectral through the gloom.</span><br />
<br />
They felt no footsteps fall beside their own,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But long their like had loved the garden well;</span><br />
And never two may walk this walk alone:<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their presence wakes a spell.</span><br />
<br />
When here live lovers loiter to and fro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With tender words and lips of kisses fain,</span><br />
Then those dead men that walked here long ago<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Meet their lost loves again.</span><br />
<br />
The grey dew keeps no traces of their feet,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Their speech is lighter than the bat's shrill cry,</span><br />
They hover where of yore they used to meet<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like shadows passing by.</span><br />
<br />
Though many wander where the moonlight lies<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Yet are they lonely as in life they were,</span><br />
For each ghost looks into his own love's eyes<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And sees no other there.</span><br />
<br />
And when the living lips their farewells frame<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the live feet turn to the garden door,</span><br />
The shades depart in darkness as they came<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And are not any more.</span><br />
<br />
Did those two guess who loved that night in June<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That others trod the grass as well as they,</span><br />
And won from them a passing moment's boon<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To love as in life's day?</span><br />
<br />
Or did they think in that still haunted place,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As those poor phantoms were they soon must be</span><br />
And pluck at other unknown lovers' grace<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The joys that once were free?</span><br />
<br />
Perchance their glad hearts thrust such thoughts away;<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of that night's tryst no more than this they own:</span><br />
That they two, in a grassy garden way<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Once walked an hour alone.</span></p></td></tr></table>
